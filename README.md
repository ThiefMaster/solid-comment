# Solid Comment

Read and write comments from your data pod. This module is intended to be embedded into an application that wants its agents to enable a platform to read and write comments.
The comments from each agent will live on their chosen data pod. When permission was given to the client (application with this module embedded) it will be able to display the agent's comments and to write new comments in it.
